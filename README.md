# MEDOC_Assignment
This project implements a face-recognition-based attendance system using OpenCV and Streamlit. It detects faces, verifies liveness using a simple anti-spoofing check, recognizes registered users, and records punch-in / punch-out attendance locally in JSON format. The system is designed for small-scale, controlled rather than security deployments.
